<h2><p> INFORMATION ABOUT ORIGAMI
<br>
Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). 
<br>
Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a 
<br>
sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.

<p><i>Interesting facts about the Origami</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).
 Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).</li>
<li>In Japan, origami has inspired a lot of art, fashion, food, 
and even architecture! If you visit, try to find all the buildings based on origami style.</li>
<li>There are more than a dozen National Origami Associations throughout the world.</li>
